tractability of  ethical discussion survey 1

Hey! I'm building a survey to investigate how people think about climate change. 
specifically, I'm looking for the following information:
1. how interested in the issue does the person identify himself or herself
2. what does the person think of the issue
3. what does the person think of the solution to the issue
4. what is the persons's self-reported believability on the issue
5. how did the person come to believe currently beliefs about the issue
6. why does the person identify with his or her interest level
7. how does the person behave in relation to his or her interest level
8. how willing is the person to learn more
 
the survey should adapt/omit some questions depending on the user's interest level. ultimately, the information can be submitted anonymously to my website and the user should receive a participation gift in the form of further resources based on interests or just friendly photos based on interests.
